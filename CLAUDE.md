## What This Project Is

VayuTransfer — prepaid wallet file transfer platform for Indian market.
Users load credits, pay per GB + per download slot, share files via secure expiring links.
Zero loss guarantee — wallet deducted before S3 upload begins.

---

## Stack (Do Not Change)

- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript
- AWS: S3 (ap-south-1), DynamoDB, SES, CloudFront
- Razorpay (payments)
- Vercel (deployment)
- Tailwind CSS

---

## Critical Business Rules (Always Enforce)

1. All money stored as PAISE (integers) — never floats
2. Wallet DEDUCTED before S3 upload URL generated
3. DynamoDB conditional writes — wallet never goes negative
4. Audit logger is FIRE-AND-FORGET — void logAudit() never await
5. Download counter is ATOMIC — DynamoDB ADD with ConditionExpression
6. Razorpay webhook IDEMPOTENT — check txnId before crediting
7. Refund wallet if upload fails or is aborted

---

## Pricing Logic

```
< 500MB   → ₹19 flat (minimum)
500MB–2GB → ₹29/GB
2GB–5GB   → ₹25/GB
5GB–10GB  → ₹22/GB
Downloads → ₹5/slot always
```

---

## DynamoDB Tables

- vayu-wallets (PK: walletId, GSI: sessionId)
- vayu-transfers (PK: fileId, GSI: walletId)
- vayu-transactions (PK: txnId, GSI: walletId)
- vayu-downloads (PK: downloadId, GSI: fileId)
- vayu-audit (PK: auditId, GSI: eventType, walletId, fileId — all with createdAt sort key)
